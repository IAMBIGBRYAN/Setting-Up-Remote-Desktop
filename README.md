To set up remote desktop on a Windows computer and access it from another computer, follow these general steps:

On the Computer You Want to Connect To (the host computer):

Check System Requirements:
Ensure that your computer is running a professional edition of Windows, such as Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Windows 11 Pro. Home editions do not support remote desktop hosting by default.

Enable Remote Desktop:


Right-click on the "This PC" or "My Computer" icon and select "Properties."
Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left-hand side.
Under the "Remote" tab, check the box that says "Allow remote connections to this computer."
Click "Apply" and then "OK."

Configure Remote Desktop Access:


You may need to configure your router to allow remote desktop connections by forwarding port 3389 to the host computer's local IP address.
Set Up a Static IP (Optional):

For a more stable connection, consider setting up a static IP address on the host computer.
On the Computer You Want to Connect From (the client computer):

Open Remote Desktop Client:

On Windows, you can press Win + R, type "mstsc," and press Enter to open the Remote Desktop client.
Enter Host Computer's IP Address or Hostname:

In the Remote Desktop client, enter the IP address or hostname of the host computer (the one you want to connect to).
Connect:

Click "Connect" or "OK," and you'll be prompted to enter the username and password for the host computer.
Authenticate:

Enter the username and password for the host computer, and click "OK."
Access the Host Computer:

Once authenticated, you should be connected to the host computer's desktop.
Please note that for security reasons, it's essential to use strong passwords and consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other security measures when setting up remote desktop access.

I recommend referring to the official Microsoft documentation or specific software documentation for more detailed and up-to-date instructions as the process may vary slightly depending on the Windows version you're using.
